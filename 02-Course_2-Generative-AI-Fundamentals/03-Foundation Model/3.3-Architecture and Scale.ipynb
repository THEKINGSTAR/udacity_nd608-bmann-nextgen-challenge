    "### The transformer architecture has revolutionized the way machines handle language by enabling the training of sequential data at scale. Thanks to this, todayâ€™s AI models are massive, with some having billions of parameters (or more) allowing for incredible flexibility across many tasks. The technology is exciting and holds great promise for the future.\n",
