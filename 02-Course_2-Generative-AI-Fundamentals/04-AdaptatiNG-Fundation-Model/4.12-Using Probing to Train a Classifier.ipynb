    "### Using probing to train a classifier is a powerful approach to tailor generative AI foundation models, like BERT, for specific applications. By adding a modestly-sized neural network, known as a classification head, to a foundation model, one can specialize in particular tasks such as sentiment analysis. This technique involves freezing the original model's parameters and only adjusting the classification head through training with labeled data. Ultimately, this process simplifies adapting sophisticated AI systems to our needs, providing a practical tool for developing efficient and targeted machine learning solutions.\n",
