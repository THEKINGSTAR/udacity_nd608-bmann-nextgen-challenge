    "### Adapting foundation models is essential due to their limitations in specific areas despite their extensive training on large datasets. Although they excel at many tasks, these models can sometimes misconstrue questions or lack up-to-date information, which highlights the need for fine-tuning. By addressing these weaknesses through additional training or other techniques, the performance of foundation models can be significantly improved.\n",
