    "### Adaptation in AI is a crucial step to enhance the capabilities of foundation models, allowing them to cater to specific tasks and domains. This process is about tailoring pre-trained AI systems with new data, ensuring they perform optimally in specialized applications and respect privacy constraints. Reaping the benefits of adaptation leads to AI models that are not only versatile but also more aligned with the unique needs of organizations and industries.\n",
