    "### Chain-of-Thought Prompting is a vital technique for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models by breaking down complex problems into intermediate steps that lead to a solution. By providing models with a line of reasoning, they can more effectively tackle problems that require more advanced problem-solving processes, enabling them to deduce information, such as the number of cookies in a box, after considering all variables.\n",
